# FuzzyPlanets

![sample](/public/sample.png?raw=true "sample")

Inspired by scribblenaughts , a puzzle game that allowed you to create brand new creations by typing up a series of seemingly random words to solve puzzles, that
would lead to unexpected results. For example, Giant angry banana would create an giant angry banana that would start attacking foes!

Fuzzy Planets gets its name from fuzzy search, the idea behind fuzzy planets is to type up Adjectives and properties of planets and let the engine
create a fun and wacky planet for you.

The Website/Engine will include a centered Text Prompt, with a default planet at the center. At the left hand side will be displayed the currently typed out 
chosen characteristics that can be selected and deleted.  The center of the screen is the chosen planet.

## Scope

The goal is to complete this project within a 1-4 month period and try to get it in production ready and polished state. This is purely just for fun and practice programming and attempt to get a pollished product out in a short period.



## Considerations

### Add Fuzzy Search
 Want to add some sort of fuzzy search functionality to the program so that the user can type what ever similar trait they wish and get the text prompt they wish.
